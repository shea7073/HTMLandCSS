    <h2>Remembering my Brother</h2>
    <p>
        I am here writing this website with the hope that it will be a place for me, my family,
        and everyone who cared for Gregory Mark Shea II to honor and remember his life cut short.
        I have added a section where you can write your own messages to or memories of Greg, along with a section where
        you can add photos.
